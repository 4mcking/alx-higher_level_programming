# Python - Input/Output

In this project, I practiced file handling in Python. I used the builtin `with`,
`open`, and `read` functions with the `json` module to read and write files and
serialize and deserialize objects with JSON.

## Files

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-read_file.py` | Function that reads a text file and prints it to stdout |
| `1-write_file.py` | Function that writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written|
| `2-append_write.py` | Function that appends a string at the end of a text file and returns the number of characters added|
| `3-to_json_string.py` | Function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)|
| `4-from_json_string.py` | Function that returns an object represented by a JSON string |
| `5-save_to_json_file.py` | Function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation|
| `6-load_from_json_file.py` | Function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”|
| `7-add_item.py` | Script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file |
| `8-class_to_json.py` | Function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure for JSON serialization of an object |
| `9-student.py` | Class `Student` that defines a student by its `first_name`, `last_name` and `age` |
| `10-student.py` | Class `Student` that defines a student with a method to retrieve a JSON representation |
| `11-student.py` | Class `Student` that defines a student with a method to load a JSON object |
| `12-pascal_triangle.py` | Function that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's triangle of `n`  |
| `100-append_after.py` | Function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string |
| `101-stats.py` | Function that reads `stdin` line by line and computes metrics |
