# Python - Everything is object
In this project, I studied object instantiation in Python, delving into
variable aliasing and object identifiers, types, and mutability. The project
involved a series of quiz-like questions the answers to which I provided in
single-line `.txt` files.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.4.3
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files

All `.txt` files store the answers to the questions asked.

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `19-copy_list.py` | Function that returns a copy of a list |
| `100-magic_string.py` | Function that returns a string "Holberton" n times the number of the iteration |
| `101-locked_class.py` | Class `LockedClass` with no class or object attribute, that prevents the user from dynamically creating new instance attributes, except if the new instance is called `first_name` |
